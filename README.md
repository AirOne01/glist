**Hi, that's Glist, more flexibility for Minecraft servers**

Glist is a Fabric mod that aims to provide support for servers to send custom blocks, textures, events and scripts to players.
Basically modding without mods, on the go, and with server-wide configurations ("mods").
That's a lot of promises already, and right now I'm just trying to implement the basics and figure out if all of this is actually possible. See the [TODO](https://github.com/AirOne01/glist#TODO).
